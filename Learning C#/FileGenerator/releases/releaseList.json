    "Description": "* Unit tests are now in the code base. Current code coverage numbers: 63%. So...there's still more work to be done, but at least it's better than 0%!\n* The exceptions are gone in the UI. This was a deliberate design decision to remove what I considered bad exception handling practices in the code base. Plus, with unit tests in place, any unexpected bugs will get covered with new unit tests in the future.",
