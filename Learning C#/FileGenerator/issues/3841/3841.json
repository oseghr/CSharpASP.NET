    "Description": "I ran into a small bug with the exporting. I'm attaching Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dll. If you export it with FileGenerator, it *almost* works perfectly. Just one little thing.\n \nIt's not exporting the private EventHandler members \"deviceCreated\", \"deviceDisposing\", and a couple others from GraphicsDeviceManager, into the .cs file. The csproj wouldn't compile until I copied them in from the Reflector disassembly.\n \nNote that when I do add those in and compile, I get a warning from the compiler that they are never assigned to (yet they are still referenced in the .cs file). Could that be the reason they do not get exported?",

So if Reflector doesn't generate this stuff for a type, I won't see it.\r\n\r\nBTW I can't gen the files based on this assembly alone, I need other references. But PLEASE don't post all the other XNA assemblies as well :).",
